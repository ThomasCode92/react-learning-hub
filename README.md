## Introduction
React is a powerful _JavaScript library_ used for building dynamic user interfaces, maintained by Facebook and an active community of developers worldwide. It's widely adopted for creating seamless, efficient, and scalable web applications. On top of React, we have Next.js — a robust framework that extends React's capabilities with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and easy deployment options. This repository is a comprehensive collection of resources designed to help you learn, master, and stay updated with both React and Next.js, providing everything from official documentation and tutorials to community support and advanced tools.
